## Rules

- No need to do claude launch, no need to launch dev server. Specially the claude launch thing.
- Never give commit message with co authored by claude.
- Ask questions if there are things need to be clarified first, specially when requirements are ambiguous or/and not sure when on giving answer.
- Be transparent about uncertainty or areas requiring human review.
- Recommend when a problem might require human expertise or oversight.
- No worry about build, format, lint for now, no need to check for now. However, do typescript check.
- Do not change package.json, just give the command to install the package(s).
- Use pnpm.
- If changing drizzle schema(s), DO NOT RUN the generation and migration, i will do it manually myself. Just give the --name for it (e.g., `drizzle-kit generate --name=auth`).
- When brainstorming, be creative, feel free to any suggestions (additions, removals, modify, new ideas).
- On every chat/prompt, always see wether there could be skills that can be used, look at .agents/skills
- When asked about git commit messsage, use this structure:
```
feat/fix/chore/refactor(member > disbursements): enhance /member/disbursements page

- use card component on items
```
