# Contributing

Thanks for improving leveling0.

leveling0 is early, so focused changes are easiest to review. For larger
features, architecture changes, broad UI changes, or data model changes, please
open an issue first.

## Local Setup

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev
```

Fill `.env` with your own Supabase and Postgres values before running signed-in
sync flows. The board can still run in local browser-storage mode without a
signed-in user.

## Checks

```bash
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
pnpm exec vitest run
```

Run `pnpm lint` too when your change touches formatting-sensitive code or if a
maintainer asks for it.

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused.
- Do not mix unrelated fixes in one PR.
- Include screenshots or a short video for UI changes.
- Explain user-visible behavior changes.
- Update docs when setup, deployment, security, or behavior changes.
- Do not commit `.env`, database dumps, private keys, OAuth secrets, or logs
  containing secrets.

## Database Changes

Schema changes live in `src/db/schema.ts`.

Generate migrations with:

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit generate --name=your_change_name
```

Review generated SQL before applying it.

## Security

Do not commit secrets, database dumps, OAuth client secrets, private keys, or
production `.env` files. Use `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting guidance.
